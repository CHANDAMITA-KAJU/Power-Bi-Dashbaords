Project: Sales Data Analysis
Objective: A deep dive into sales data, aimed at extracting valuable
insights to enhance strategic decision-making.

Description:
In this project, I have done some Data cleaning to make the data suitable to use itfor further analysis. I explored the sales dataset to extract valuable insights, examined sales trends over time, identified the best-selling products, calculated revenue metrics such as total sales and and created visualizations to present my findings effectively. This project showcased my ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling me to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.

Tools Used: MS-Excel, Power BI
▪ Excel : Used for Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation
▪ PowerBI : Used DAX to derive valuable insights through calculations and measures and for creating interactive & visually appealing dashboards and charts.

Here are some highlights from my Project :-

1. Highest Sales Month :- In December month, the highest sales of 4.6M.
2. Star Product :- The MacBook Pro Laptop is the top-selling product of 8M among all items in our inventory.
3. Top 5 Best Sellers :- Top 5 sold products include, MacBook Pro Laptop, iPhone, ThinkPad Laptop, Google Phone and 27-inch 4K Gaming Monitor.
4. Total Sales is 34.49M and Average Price is 184M.
5. Total Quantity Sold is 209K.
6. San Francisco is Top city by sales.

Recommendations-
1. We can see from the right bottom table that the sales is highest in between the time 12-3pm and 6-9pm. Hence we can give promotional offers  to attract a greater no. of customers thereby increasing the net sales.
2. In the Sales by city line and stacked column chart, the avg price of Dallas is slightly high due to which the sales is comparatively low in the city, hence we should take proper measure to fix this problem.
3. Inventory should be kept accordingly to meet the sales needs.


Limitations: Since the provided dataset was limited I couldn't deep dive into the data.
