# Business-Insight-360

Problem Statement:-
The project involved solving a business problem for an imaginary company called AtliQ Hardware, which manufactures and sells hardware products globally. The company previously relied on Microsoft Excel for analysis, but with an expansion of operations and an increase in data, the product owner wanted the analytics team to create a dashboard using Power BI to track key metrics from various departments and generate insights.

𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄: Discover insights into Product Performance, examine Market, Regional, and Customer Performances. Evaluate GM% & NP% Performance across different segments. Also, explore Unit economics with COGS, Operational expenses, and NP.

𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗹𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄: Investigate Forecast Accuracy, Net Error, and ABS Error, revealing key metrics by Customer based on FA/NE/ABSE. Track Accuracy/Net Error Trends and dive into key metrics by Product.
